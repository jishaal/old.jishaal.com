<img src={meImg} className={styles.ProfileImg} alt="code explaining" />

I'm a Senior Frontend Developer + People Lead at Xero with 5+ years in the industry. I work with modern frontend
technologies such as React, Redux, Node.js and TypeScript.

The web has fascinated me since I was a child, having created and deployed my first website in my teens during the early 2000s.
Since then, technologies that help power today's websites has changed dramatically allowing us to create seamless
experiences and solve problems in ways deemed impossible just a few years ago.
