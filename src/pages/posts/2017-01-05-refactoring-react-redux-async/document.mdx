The previous [two](https://devblog.xero.com/a-saga-that-led-xero-to-redux-aa1361b9a800#.k5d5tjvjf) [articles](https://devblog.xero.com/learning-and-scaling-a-react-redux-app-with-a-distributed-team-e4c397def187#.faj7m031u)
in this series highlighted how frontend development practices at Xero have evolved over the past decade, and how we have
resorted to building complex applications using React and Redux. With building any application at scale, user-interactions
that lead to a number of side-effects are unavoidable. This article will focus specifically on how we have come to use
Redux Saga to manage these side-effects.

## Early patterns

During the initial implementation of applications at Xero, the theme was to handle side-effect driven functionality in the lifecycle methods of React components.
A common example of this was activating an asynchronous API call to fetch some data in `componentDidMount()`. While code in this form is not necessarily incorrect,
it has the potential to make components more complex than they should be. This has a flow-on effect to the testability and maintainability of the component in-hand,
where business logic is tied to the view/render layer.

Therefore if components are only concerned with rendering and dispatching actions while reducers are pure functions that calculate a new state,
then where can impure business logic live? A code review from some Xero developers with more React and Redux experience led to a
strong recommendation that instance lifecycle methods were not the place to call APIs, and we should look at middleware for Redux.
We settled on using Redux Saga to encapsulate all of our business logic and haven’t looked back since.

The first uses of sagas we implemented were simple API fetch calls, such as the example below.

```javascript
import { takeEvery } from 'redux-saga';
import { call, put } from 'redux-saga/effects';

import * as actionTypes from '../action-types';
import * as api from '../api';

export function* createInvoice(action) {
  try {
    const resp = yield call(api.createInvoice, action.payload);

    yield put(actionTypes.receiveInvoice(resp));
  } catch (error) {
    yield put(actionTypes.createInvoiceFailure(error));
  }
}

export function* createInvoiceWatcher() {
  yield takeEvery(actionTypes.CREATE_INVOICE, createInvoice);
}
```

While the above example is self-contained and simple — making an API call and dealing with the response — evolving requirements
quickly led to far more bloated sagas which were both less readable and less testable. Immediately there were many different
paths through the code (due to nested control blocks), which led to multiple test cases without even beginning to test the
actual functionality (for example data being correctly defaulted/overridden). Additionally, while saga tests are conceptually
quite simple, they require a large amount of boilerplate (as every step needs to be run using `sagaFunction.next()`).

## Modularize and compose

The solution was to split the saga into smaller, more functional blocks (which live in the same file), as in general they
are concerned with a single user interaction (for example creating an invoice) and are only exported for testing purposes.
Splitting them made tests simpler, more modular and easier to understand. Even `createInvoice()`, which kicks off the saga chain,
only really needs to test ‘can create’ logic, and that appropriate sagas are run in each case.

```javascript
// import(s)
...
// Make API Call, indicate fetching status
export function* postInvoice(invoice) {
  try {
    const resp = yield call(api.createInvoice, invoice);

    yield put(actionTypes.receiveInvoice(resp));
  } catch (error) {
    yield put(actionTypes.createInvoiceFailure(error));
  }
}

// Default / Manipulate data
export function defaultAttribute(invoiceDetails) {
  return {
    status: 'defaultValue',
    ...invoiceDetails
  };
}

// Listen for trigger, check data is valid, aggregate other sagas
export function* createInvoice() {
  const canCreateInvoice = yield select(getInvoiceIsValid);

  if (canCreateInvoice) {
    const invoiceDetails = yield select(getInvoiceDetails);
    const invoice = yield call(defaultAttribute(invoiceDetails);

    yield fork(postInvoice, invoice);
  } else {
    yield put(actionTypes.alertCannotCreateInvoice());
  }
};

// Root 'takeEvery Saga'
...
```

But, before we go too deep into modularizing each and every part of a saga’s functionality, isn’t there a risk we’ll end
up right where we were 5–10 years ago with spaghetti functions, ‘callback hell’ and totally unreadable code? The beauty of
Redux Saga (or more generally generator functions) is that ‘forking’ to another saga still maintains unidirectional flow.
With considered use of `fork` and `call` functions, side-effects can be controlled and dealt with whilst maintaining a
logical unidirectional flow.

## Sharing and collaborating

At this point we had another opportunity to share our work with other teams, and get another perspective. This was a rewarding
process, which highlighted that perhaps modularization of sagas detracted from the developer’s way of looking at them — as
a function representing a single user interaction with a unidirectional flow to match.

Conversely, this conversation highlighted that there certainly are cases for more modular sagas, as we gained exposure
to other team’s implementations. The examples below shows the end result of a discussion we had with the Xero Dashboard
project team, who created the complex saga [we covered back in article one](https://devblog.xero.com/a-saga-that-led-xero-to-redux-aa1361b9a800#.6wykgqwm6).

```javascript

// 2016 — React/Redux Sagas
export function* listenForRefreshFeedAction() {
  yield* takeEvery(actionTypes.REFRESH_FEED, refreshFeed);
}
function* refreshFeed(action) {
  const endpoints = yield select(endpointsSelector);
  const initialRequestResponse = yield call(xhrPost, endpoints.refreshFeed, action.payload);
  if (initialRequestResponse.Success) {
    yield put(actionTypes.REFRESH_FEED_IN_PROGRESS);
    // poll messaging services to get an update on long running task
    let pollResponse;
    for (let count = 0; count < POLL_ITERATIONS; count++) {
      yield call(delay, POLL_FREQUENCY);
      const pollResponse = yield call(xhrPost, endpoints.poll, initialRequestResponse.pollPayload);
      const parsedPollResponse = parsePollResponses(pollResponse ); //helper that makes sense of the pollResponse
      if (parsedPollResponse.keepPolling) {
        yield put({type: actionTypes.REFRESH_FEED_UPDATE, parsedPollResponse});
      } else {
        count = POLL_ITERATIONS;
      }
    }
    yield put({type: actionTypes.REFRESH_FEED_POLL_COMPLETE, parsedPollResponse});
    if (parsedPollResponse && parsedPollResponse.action === POLL_COMPLETE) {
      if (parsedPollResponse.bankSecurityChallange) {
        const bankChallengeResponse= yield call(xhrPost, endpoints.bankSecurityChallange, pollResponse);
        if (bankChallengeResponse && bankChallengeResponse.Success) {
          yield put({type: actionTypes.REFRESH_FEED_SECURITY_SUCCESS, bankChallengeResponse});
        } else {
          yield put({type: actionTypes.REFRESH_FEED_SECURITY_FAILED, bankChallengeResponse});
        }
      }
    } else {
      yield put({type: actionTypes.REFRESH_FEED_POLL_FAIL, pollResponse});
    }
  } else {
    yield put({type: actionTypes.REFRESH_FEED_FAIL, initialRequestResponse});
  }
}
```

As you can see, this single saga has a lot of responsibilities. Applying our thinking on modularizing large sagas we
can `fork` sagas, `doPolling`, and `bankSecurityChallenge`, which were originally part of the single extended saga. Both
contain API calls and varied logic themselves, which made the single saga long, less readable, and involved a large
amount of boilerplate code in each test. By breaking these apart, we can now also test each saga function separately.

``` javascript
export function* listenForRefreshFeedAction() {
  yield* takeEvery(actionTypes.REFRESH_FEED, refreshFeed);
}

function* refreshFeed(action) {
  const endpoints = yield select(endpointsSelector);
  const initialRequestResponse = yield call(xhrPost, endpoints.refreshFeed, action.payload);

  if (initialRequestResponse.Success) {
    yield fork(doPolling, initialRequestResponse)
  } else {
    yield put({type: actionTypes.REFRESH_FEED_FAIL, initialRequestResponse});
  }
}

function* doPolling(initialRequestResponse) {
  yield put(actionTypes.REFRESH_FEED_IN_PROGRESS);
  // poll messaging services to get an update on long running tas
  let pollResponse;

  for (let count = 0; count < POLL_ITERATIONS; count++) {
    yield call(delay, POLL_FREQUENCY);
    pollResponse = yield call(xhrPost, endpoints.poll, initialRequestResponse.pollPayload);
    const parsedPollResponse = parsePollResponses(pollResponse ); // helper that makes sense of the pollResponse

    if (parsedPollResponse.keepPolling) {
      yield put({type: actionTypes.REFRESH_FEED_UPDATE, parsedPollResponse});
    } else {
      count = POLL_ITERATIONS;
    }
  }

  yield put({type: actionTypes.REFRESH_FEED_POLL_COMPLETE, parsedPollResponse});

  if (parsedPollResponse && parsedPollResponse.action === POLL_COMPLETE) {
    if (parsedPollResponse.bankSecurityChallenge) {
      yield fork(bankSecurityChallenge);
    }
  } else {
    yield put({type: actionTypes.REFRESH_FEED_POLL_FAIL, pollResponse});
  }
}

function* bankSecurityChallenge() {
// ... call the API to initiate bank challenge
}
```
As you can see, feedback and discussion in this way was extremely rewarding, as it brought to light limitations in
different team’s implementation of the Redux Saga library. Even more so, it helped get the ball rolling towards a
more cohesive, cross-team concept of saga best practice, which should ultimately improve company-wide understanding
and implementation of sagas, among other frontend tools and modules.

## Evolving frontend practices

Throughout the three articles in this series, we have covered a decade worth of frontend practices at Xero.
The past year has seen the most significant change in frontend in our nearly 10 year history. From rebuilding old parts
such as the Xero Dashboard, to completely new projects such as Xero HQ, and the introduction of a common pattern library,
we are moving toward a more cohesive experience for not only our developers, but also our users. As a team, we have great
confidence in our current stack of tools and how it has made developing complex user-interfaces easier and quicker.
As the state of frontend evolves, we aim to evolve with it. The saga continues.
